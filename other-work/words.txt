In the campus, college students are so excited about the new life and they want to make friends with others who are coming from different areas. So taking part in activities can help them to improve their talents and also make more friends. But some people doubt that activities will distract students’ attention. In my opinion, activity is part of campus life.
在大学校园里，大学生都对新生活感到很兴奋，他们想和来自其他不同地区的学生交朋友。所以参加活动可以帮助他们提高才能，交到更多的朋友。但有些人却怀疑活动会分散学生的注意力。在我看来，活动是校园生活的一部分。

It is obvious that campus life provides students more stages to communicate and show their talents, so they need to find the chance by joining the activities. Some students make a lot of friends who share the same interest, or find the stage to show their talents. The meaning of activities is to improve students’ ability to communicate, which is of great importance to their future life.
很明显，校园生活给学生提供了更多的舞台去进行交流和展示自己的才能，所以他们需要通过参加活动去找机会。有些学生交到很多志同道合的朋友，有些找到了展示自己才华的舞台。活动的意义在于提高学生交际能力，这对他们未来的生活是很重要的。

Activities can’t be ignored in campus life, but students must keep in their minds that study is their top priority. They are in the stage of preparing for skills, which means major knowledge and the ability to deal with relationships. So both study and activities are indispensable part of college life.
校园活动是不容忽视的，但学生必须牢记学习是他们的首要任务。他们在储备技能阶段，也就意味着是培养专业知识和处理人际关系的能力。所以学习和活动是大学生活不可或缺的一部分。
